ðŸ”¥ Challenge 3: ATM Simulation
Goal: Design an ATM system for handling withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.

Requirements
Encapsulation:
BankAccount class with a private __balance.
Operator Overloading (-)
account1 - account2 transfers balance.
Magic Methods (__str__)
Print account details.


##solution
ATM Simulation
The BankAccount class meets all requirements:

1.Encapsulation:
Private __balance attribute with appropriate methods for accessing and modifying it
deposit(), withdraw(), and transfer() methods provide controlled access to the balance


2.Operator Overloading:
The - operator is overloaded through __sub__ to transfer the entire balance from one account to another
When you do account1 - account2, it transfers all money from account1 to account2


3.Magic Methods:
__str__ method prints account details in the specified format.
