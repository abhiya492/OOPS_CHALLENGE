ðŸ”¥ Challenge 4: Ride Sharing App (Like Uber)
Goal: Design a ride-sharing system where multiple vehicle types have different fare calculations.

Requirements
Encapsulation:
Private __fare_per_km in Vehicle.
Inheritance & Polymorphism:
Bike, Car, SUV override calculate_fare().
Magic Methods (__str__)
Print ride details.


##solution
Ride Sharing App
The ride-sharing implementation meets all requirements:

Encapsulation:

Private __fare_per_km attribute with getter/setter methods


Inheritance & Polymorphism:

Bike, Car, and SUV classes inherit from the Vehicle base class
Each subclass can override the calculate_fare() method (SUV adds a comfort charge)


Magic Methods:

__str__ method displays vehicle details
